# About AmeitsuFreeWriter (FW)
This is an **ultra-simple text editor for Windows**, and is highly customized according to my demands.
It is planned that this project will include the following functions:
- Editing short pieces of text when you need to, for example "preparing" for an online chat.
- Practice stuff that is generally easy but requires plenty of practicings, like names of chemical elements. Customised training functions can be created using FW.
- Send emails. But the mails are bound to be sent into the rubbish bin.
- more......
